For making the application run, follow these steps:
1) Make sure that JDK version greater than 1.5 is installed in your machine.
2) Import the "AdminConsole" project inside "SourceCode" folder into your Eclipse Workspace.
3) You will see compilation errors due to missing jars. Therefore add all the jars in the "Jars" folder from the CD in the project build path.
4) Run the "GUI" class to start the application.

For working on individual components:
1) Import the respective component project folder from "SourceCode" folder into your eclipse workspace.
2) Initially you will see compilation errors due to missing jars. Therefore include the necessary jars from the "Jars" folder from the CD in the project build path.
3) Start working on the code once compilation errors are resolved.
Eg: If you want to work on component Car, import the "Car" project inside "SourceCode" folder into your eclipse workspace. Car component needs the following jars :
	-UserPanel
	-Door
	-DoorPanel
	-UserPanelQueue
	-CarController
These jars are available in the "Jars" folder which can be added to the build path of Car project.
